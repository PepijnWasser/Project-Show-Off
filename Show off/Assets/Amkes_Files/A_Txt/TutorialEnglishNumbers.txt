1. I am leaving this Island soon and I need to find someone to take over. I think you're right for the job, but you need to prove yourself. Could you do some small tasks for me?
2. These are the tasks you could complete today, every task will have an effect on the coral’s health and Island popularity.
3. Each task will cost 1 or 2 energy. Today you have 3 energy to spend.
4. Looks like the coral reef gained some health. Good job!
5. That was a great first day in charge. Let’s see what tomorrow brings. I’ll be here if you need anything. Good luck!
6. Pollution damages the coral reefs. Cleaning up trash is a good way to take care of our environment.
7. Tourists are our main form of livelihood, this is why popularity is so important!
8. Too many tourists isn’t always a good thing, they contribute to our coral reef’s declining health by accidentally breaking it and polluting.
9. Our island is known for its beautiful resorts inspired by our ancestors original building style.
10. When corals are damaged they lose their bright colours due to bleaching.
