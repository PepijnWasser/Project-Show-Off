I am leaving this Island soon and I need to find someone to take over. I think you're right for the job, but you need to prove yourself. Could you do some small tasks for me?
These are the tasks you could complete today, every task will have an effect on the coral’s health and Island popularity.
Each task will cost 1 or 2 energy. Today you have 3 energy to spend.
Looks like the coral reef gained some health. Good job!
That was a great first day in charge. Let’s see what tomorrow brings. I’ll be here if you need anything. Good luck!
